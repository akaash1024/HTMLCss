## **Adjacent / Immediate sibling Selector in CSS**

- The adjacent sibling selector is used when we want to apply the CSS property or styling to the adjacent sibling of any element.
- The siblings should have the same parent element and also the second element must be the immediate follower of the first element.
- The selectors are separated by adding the (+) sign between the separators.
