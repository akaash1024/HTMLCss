> flex applied on parents.


flex : wrap : top left to bottom right
flex: wrap-reverse : bottom right corner to the top left corner
        #try using abobe link



alien items :  Keep nowrap them works

alien content :  Keep wrap then works



taking notes from notebook
suppose, flex - direction: row;
        justify content react horizontally (right/left) - main axis
        alien-items react vertically (up/down) - cross axit
      **alien content : react with wrap only

Selector : pseudo-class
Selector :: pseudo-elements


------------------
Basis
flex-direction: row;
flex-basis: 100px; //working with main-axis (width)

flex-direction: column;
flex-basis: 220px; //working with cross-axis (height)
